<h1><strong><center> API SSH Gateway</center> </strong></h1>

The API SSH gateway was primarily written to work with Cisco networking devices. As most networking devices don’t have API interfaces, access is mainly restricted to SSH or overly complex Netconf which uses YANG. 

The CLI holds a wealth of information but getting access to this information (quickly and at scale) can be a challenge. Once the SSH API server is online (SSH sessions are established), an API call is sent to the API interface which relays an incoming request (embedded within the JSON) into a queuing agent. The queuing agent is responsible for queuing and responding to each API request. 

Having all SSH sessions permanently connected has its advantages. The most noteworthy is no setup lag. This reduces the delay from receiving the API call, setting up each SSH session and then responding. As there is only one established SSH session (per device), only one API call can be processed at any time. If multiple requests are received, they are processed in a first come, first serve basis.

The API SSH gateway is built using threading. Once SSH sessions are established, they remain active. If a SSH session drops or is disconnected, the API SSH gateway will try and reestablish it. To stop the SSH sessions from going stale, every 5 seconds, the server will press enter on the remote device. If an API request arrives for a device which is not established then the result will say “SSH session not established’. For example, if 2 out of 50 devices are offline, the offline devices are skipped, results will be seen from the other 48 and an error for the skipped two. 

For simplicity, I’ve created a tool which parses YAML. An example of the YAML structure is found in the repo (named test.yaml). The fetch.py file is responsible for parsing the YAML file, creating the JSON, sending the API, receiving the results and writing the results to the output folder.

<center><h3 style="color: green"> Environment setup (Linux and Mac)</h3></center>

Start by creating an new directory called projects (or any other name)

mkdir projects<br>
cd projects

Then clone the git repository
https://github.com/atxit/ssh_api_gateway.git

Next, cd ssh_api_gateway and create a python venv

python3 -m venv env<br> 
source env/bin/activate<br> 
pip3 install --upgrade pip<br> 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br> 


<center><b>API Username and Password</b></center>

I have added a file called authentication_module.py which is imported during startup. This file contains a static username and password however, this could easily be integrated into LDAP (and should be) if used in a production network. 

<b><center>Server setup</center></b>

The server can be setup using three different methods:

1)	Using the setup wizard. No information is saved
2)	Using the auth_file.txt and server_cfg.txt files
3)	entered authentication arguments. 

Note: configuration options found in the server_cfg.txt file can not be passed as arguments
They must be provided using the wizard or directly from the file. 

Arguments

  -h, --help          		show this help message and exit<br>
  -auth_cfg           		uses local cred file<br>
  -username USERNAME  	ssh username<br>
  -password PASSWORD 	ssh password<br>
  -api_key API_KEY    	API Key, minimum 10 characters<br>
  -wizard             		enter setup wizard mode

When -auth_cfg flag is entered, the auth_cfg.txt file is used.<br>
If no flag is seen then the wizard starts.<br>
or -auth_cfg flag is flagged then -username, -password and -api_key must be provided.

Example: Starting the server using arguments
<i>python3 ssh_api.py -username admin -password cisco -api_key 5544332233444</i>

Example: Starting the server using the auth_file
<i>python3 main.py -auth_cfg</i>

Example: Starting the server using the wizard
<i>python3 main.py</i>

Before starting, configure the yaml file

Note, output folder is where the results are saved<br>
if the path starts with a / then this is considered a full path
if the path doesn't start with a /, example, test/file then current folder is used as the base dir


python3 fetch.py test.yaml or python3 fetch.py test #either is acceptable.<br>

Errors are displayed

</i>
Both 192.168.0.220 and .224 are configured in the YAML however, neither are online.
